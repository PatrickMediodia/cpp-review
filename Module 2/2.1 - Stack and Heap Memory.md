- by default, variables live in the stack memory (method call stack)

`&` Operator
- get the memory address of a variable
- stack starts from the top going down
- heap starts from the bottom going up

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	int num = 7;

	std::cout << "Value: " << num << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Address: " << &num << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

**Stack Memory**
- by default, variables in c++ is placed in the stack memory
- stack memory is associated with the current function
	- its lifecycle is tied to the function
	- therefore, when the function returns or ends, the stack memory of that function is released
- always start from high memory addresses and grows down
	- starts from high and grow down towards 0

```
#include <iostream>

void foo() {
	int x = 42;
	std::cout << " x in foo(): " << x << std::endl;
	std::cout << "&x in food():" << &x << std::endl;
}

int main() {
	int num = 7;
	std::cout << " num in main(): " << num << std::endl;
	std::cout << "&num in main(): " << &num << std::endl;

	foo();

	return 0;
}
```

**Stack Representation**
```
-----------
main()
	num = 7
-----------
foo()
	x = 42
-----------
```
- `main()` is called first and put it in the stack with the variable `num =7`
- `main()` calls `foo()` so it is pushed to the call stack with a variable `x = 42`
- the address of x is less than num

**Pointers**
- variable that stores the memory address of data
	- pointers are a level of indirection from the data
- use the `*` to denote that a variable is a pointer
	- `int *p = num;`
- dereferencing a pointer is used to get the value stored in the address that the pointer points to
```
int *p = &num;
std::cout << p // prints the address
std::cout << *p // prints the value
```

- problem is that the Cube object is created in stack memory of the `CreateUnitCube()` function
	- meaning that once the method call is popped from the stack, its corresponding variables are also released/de-allocated
- ***never return a local variable from a function***
	- this is why it is important to understand how memory is allocated

**Final Program**
```
int main() {
	int num = 7; // store 7 in variable num
	std::cout << " num: " << num << std::endl; // print num with value 7
	std::cout << "&num: " << &num << std::endl; // print the addres of num

	int *p = &num;
	std::cout << " p: " << p << std::endl; // print the address of num
	std::cout << "&p: " << &p << std::endl; // print the address of the pointer
	std::cout << "*p: " << *p << std::endl; // dereference pointer and print value that it points to

	*p = 42; // dereference pointer and change value to 42
	std::cout << "*p: changed to 42" << std::endl;
	std::cout << " num: " << num << std::endl; // new value of num is 42
}
```
