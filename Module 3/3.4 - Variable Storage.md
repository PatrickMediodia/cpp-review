- ways variables can be stored
	- directly in memory *(by value)*
	- through a pointer *(by pointer)*
	- or through a reference *(by reference)*

![[Pasted image 20241013191434.png]]

**Direct Storage**
- by default, all variables are directly stored in memory
	- the type of a variable has no modifiers (`*`, `&`)
	- object takes up exactly its size in memory

```
Cube c; // stores a cube in memory
int i; // stores in integer in memory
uuic::HSLAPixel p; // stores a pixel in memory
```

**Storage by Pointer**
- type of a variable is modified with an asterisk (`*`)
- a pointer takes a memory address width of memory
- points to the allocated space of the object

```
Cube *c; // pointer to a cube in memory
int *i; // pointer to an integer in memory
uuic::HSLAPixel *p; // pointer to a pixel in memory
```

**Storage by Reference**
- is an alias to existing memory and is denoted in the type with an ampersand (`&`)
- does not store memory itself, it is an alias to another variable
	- a reference variable has no size, 0 bytes in memory
- refers to something in memory
- the alias must be assigned when the variable is initialized

```
Cube &c = cube; // alias to the variable `cube`
int &i = count; // alias to the variable `i`
uiuc::HSLAPixel &p; // an alias must alias something when it is initialzied
```

**Sample Cube Currency Analogy**
`Cube.cpp`
```
namespace uuic {
	// custome one-parameter constructor
	// creates a new cube
	Cube::Cube(double length) {
		length_ = obj.length_;
		std::cout << Created $" << getVolume() << std::endl;
	}

	// custom copy constructor
	// creates a new cube and copies the value of the existing cube
	Cube::Cube(const Cube &obj) {
		length_ = obj.length_;
		std::cout << "Created &" << getVolume() << std::endl;
	}

	// copy assignment
	// changes the value of an existing cube based on the value of another cube
	Cube & Cube::operator=(const Cube &obj) { 
		std::cout << "Transformed &" << getVolume() << "-> $" << obj.getVolume() << std::endl;
		length_ = obj.length_;
		return *this; // always return an instance of the class
	}
}
```

**Transfer By Value**
```
int main() {
	Cube c(10); // constructor

	Cube myCube = c; // copy constructor

	return 0;
}
```
- creates a new object altogether
	1. constructor
	2. copy constructor

![[Pasted image 20241013193831.png]]

**Transfer by Reference**
```
int main() {
	Cube c(10); // one-parameter custom constructor

	Cube &myCube = c; // create a reference to c;

	return 0;
}
```
- only one object is created
- and then an alias to that object is created
	- this points to the same object in memory
	- effectively having `c` and `myCube` point to the same thing in memory

**Transfer by Reference**
```
int main() {
	Cube c(10); // 1. one-parameter custom constructor

	Cube *myCube = &c; // 2. Set myCube pointer to the address of c

	return 0;
}
```

**Passing Variables to Functions**
- same as how we can store variables
	- value (default)
	- reference (`&`)
	- pointer (`*`)

**Pass by Value**
```
bool sendCube (Cube c) {}

int main() {
	Cube c(10); // 1. Create cube

	sendCube(c); // pass by value, triggers the copy constructor

	return 0;
}
```
- creates the cube in main
- copies the cube into the `sendCube` stack frame

**Pass by Reference**
```
bool sendCube(Cube &c) {}

int main() {
	Cube c(10);

	sendCube(c);

	return 0;
}
```
- creates the cube in main
- pass only a reference to the cube created in main to sendCube

Pass by Pointer
```
bool sendCube(Cube *c) {}

int main() {
	Cube c(10);

	sendCube(&c);

	return 0;
}
```
- creates the cube in main
- calls `sendCube` with the address of cube as arguments
- `sendCube` gets the the address of cube and stores it as a pointer

***NEVER RETURN A REFERENCE TO A STACK VARIABLE CREATED ON THE STACK***
