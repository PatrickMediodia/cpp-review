- allows for a class to inherit all member functions and data from a base class into a derived class

![[Pasted image 20241016182908.png]]
`Shape.h`
```
#pragma once

class Shape {
	public:
		Shape();
		Shape(double width);
		double getWidth() const;

	private:
		double width_;
}
```
- includes generic functions and data that all types of shapes have

```
class <derived> : public <base> {}
```

`Cube.h`
```
#pragma once

#include "Shape.h"
#include "HSLAPixel.h"

namespace uiuc {
	// Cube inherits Shape
	class Cube : public Shape {
		// these functions are specific to the Cube class
		public:
			Cube(double width, uiuc:HSLAPixel color);
			double getVolume() const;
		private:
			uiuc::HSLAPixel color_;
	};
}
```
