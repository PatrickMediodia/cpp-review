- defines the behavior when an object is copied using the assignment `=` operator
- similar to a copy constructor, but
	- copy constructor **creates a new object**
	- while an **assignment operator assigns a value to an existing object**
- an assignment operator is always called on an object that has already been constructed
- an object can only be constructed once
	- in order to change its value, you need to do an assignment operation

**Automatic Assignment Operator**
- if no custom assignment operator is supplied, an automatic assignment operator is given by `c++`
- copy the contents of all member variables

**Custom Assignment Operator**
- must have the ff properties
	- public member function of the class
	- has the function name `operator=`
	- has a return value of a reference of the class type
	- has exactly one argument
		- the argument must be const reference of the class type
```
Cube & Cube::operator=(const Cube &obj)
```

`Cube.cpp`
```
namespace uuic {
	Cube::Cube() {
		length_ = 1;
		std::cout << "Default Constructor" << std::endl;
	}

	Cube::Cube(const Cube &obj) {
		length_ = obj.length_;
		std::cout << "Copy Constructor" << std::endl;
	}

	Cube & Cube::operator=(const Cube &obj) {
		length_ = obj.length_;
		std::cout << "Copy Assignment" << std::endl;

		return *this; // always return an instance of the class
	}
}
```

`main.cpp`
```
#include "Cube.h"

using uiuc::Cube;

int main() {
	Cube c; // 1. default constructor
	Cube myCube; // 2. default constructor

	myCube = c; // 3. copy assignment

	return = 0;
}
```

- functionality between a copy constructor and copy assignment is largely the same
	- their job is to copy the contents of an instance of a class to another
	- it is more of when it is invoked
- Copy Constructor
	- copy object contents on initialization
- Copy Assignment
	- copy object contents on an already existing object
