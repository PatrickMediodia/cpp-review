**Use Case**
- allows the creation of memory intendent of the lifecycle of a function
- if memory needs to exist for longer than the lifecycle of the funciton, we must use heap memory

**How to Create**
- use the `new` keyword to create heap memory in `c++`
- the `new` keyword returns a pointer to the memory storing the data
	- not an instance of the data itself
	- this gives the ***starting*** memory address that the variable is located in
- things you need to remember
	1. allocate memory on the heap for the data structure
	2. initialize the data structure
	3. return a pointer to the start of the data structure
- memory is ***only*** every reclaimed by the system when the pointer is passed to the `delete` operator

```
int *numPtr = new int;
```
- allocates two chunks of memory
	- integer pointer to the stack
	- integer on the heap

**Sample Program**
```
int main() {
	int *numPtr = new int; // create a new pointer variable and an int on the heap
	std::cout << "*numPtr: " << *numPtr << std::endl; // print the value of the heap
	std::cout << " numPtr: " << numPtr << std::endl; // print the address on the heap
	std::cout << "&numPtr: " << &numPtr << std::endl; // print the address of the pointer pointing to the heap

	*numPtr = 42; // assign the value 42 to the dereferenced value on the heap
	std::cout << "*numPtr assigned 42." << std::endl;

	std::cout << "*numPtr: " << *numPtr << std::endl; // print the value on the heap which is 42
	std::cout << " numPtr: " << numPtr << std::endl; // print the memory address in heap memory, this should be the same
	std::cout << "&numPtr: " << &numPtr << std::endl; // print the memory address in stack, this should be the same
}
```

- at the end, the pointers don't have data they point to anymore, this is a big problem

**`nullptr`**
- is a pointer that points to the memory address `0x0`
- represents a pointer to `"nowhere"`
	- address `0x0` is reserved and never used by the system
	- address `0x0` will always generate a `segmentation fault` when accessed
	- calls to `delete` `0x0` are ignored
- this prevents dangling pointers
- this is `NULL` in `C`

```
int main() {
	int *p = new int;
	Cube *c = new Cube;

	*p = 42;
	(*c).setLength(4);

	delete c; // delete value in heap
	c = nullptr; // point pointer to `0x0`

	delete p;  // delete value in heap
	p = nullptr; // point pointer to `0x0`

	return 0;
}
```

**Arrow Operator**
- when an object is stored via pointer, access can be made to member functions using the `->` operator
	- `c->getVolume();` is identical to `(*c).getVolume();`

**Final Example**
```
int main() {
	Cube *c1 = new Cube;
	Cube *c2 = c1;

	c2->setLength(10);

	delete c2;
	delete c1;

	return 0;
}
```
